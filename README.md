# Web-Lazy-Loading-
Python script that automatically adds loading="lazy" attributes to &lt;img> and &lt;video> tags in HTML files across a directory tree. Uses regex to find tags without lazy loading and modifies them to improve web performance by deferring off-screen media loading. Perfect for optimizing static sites with many images.
